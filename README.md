# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System implemented using Python and the Pandas library.

## Introduction
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their historical preferences. This is achieved by analyzing user-movie interaction data and identifying patterns in their preferences.

## Google Colab Notebook
For a detailed walkthrough of the implementation, you can refer to the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shrutin567/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/movie_recommendation_system.ipynb). This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to the code and explanations for each part of the recommendation system.

## Dataset
